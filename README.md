## 🚀 Project Overview

DeepPersona is a simulated phishing tool designed to mimic an HR chatbot on a careers page. It uses natural language responses and emotional cues to:
- Engage a victim in conversation
- Tailor messages based on user input
- Trigger mock phishing pages for document uploads like resumes, ID proofs, or offer letters

The core goal is to demonstrate how AI-powered HR chatbots can be weaponized for targeted phishing (spear phishing) attacks.
